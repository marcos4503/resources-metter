You can even put it on a secondary monitor and watch it while you play for example. It's useful to know how your Hardware consumption is, current time and other things!

This project uses the library "LibreHardwareMonitor" to obtain the temperature and uses of hardware informations. You can refer to <a href="https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor" target="_blank">this</a> link for more details about the library.
